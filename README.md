# Soundify

Sightreading made easy.

## Inspiration

Most of us have learned music theory before, often through sight reading platforms like Sight Reading Factory. However, in loud classrooms setting, these programs are difficult to use due to their reliance on sound. Furthermore, young children may not be apt to understanding music notation and would benefit from an accessible activity to bolster their rhythmic skills.

## What it does

The web app generates a rhythm that is illustrated in a scrolling bar which the user must tap out using their hands. The webcam then captures finger movements to detect rhythm accuracy.

## How we built it

We used Svelte for the web frontend, and Mediapipe for the hand recognition portion.
